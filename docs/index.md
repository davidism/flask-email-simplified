# Flask-Email-Simplified

Flask-Email-Simplified is a [Flask]/[Quart] extension that provides email
sending capability using the [Email-Simplified] library.

Email-Simplified provides a much simpler interface for creating and sending
email messages compared to Python's {mod}`email` and {mod}`smtplib` modules. It
also defines an interface for using other email sending providers that offer an
API other than SMTP.
